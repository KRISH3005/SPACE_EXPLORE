                <h3>Mercury</h3>
                <p>Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system. It's just a little bigger than Earth's Moon. Mercury itself, though, doesn't have any moons. It is the closest planet to the Sun, but it's actually not the hottest</p>

            <div class="planet" id="venus">
                <img src="venus.webp" alt="Venus">
                <h3>Venus</h3>
                <p>Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is the brightest planet in the solar system. It is sometimes referred to as the sister planet to Earth, because of the similar mass and size. The planet is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty.</p>

                <h3>Earth</h3>
                <p>Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is the brightest planet in the solar system. It is sometimes referred to as the sister planet to Earth, because of the similar mass and size. The planet is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty.</p>

                <img src="mars.jpeg" alt="Mars">
                <h3>Mars</h3>
                <p>Mars is sometimes called the Red Planet. It's red because of rusty iron in the ground. Like Earth, Mars has seasons, polar ice caps, volcanoes, canyons, and weather. It has a very thin atmosphere made mostly of carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and argon.</p>

            <div class="planet" id="jupiter">
                <img src="jupiter.jpeg" alt="Jupiter">
                <h3>Jupiter</h3>
                <p>It's the largest planet in our solar system. If Jupiter was a hollow shell, 1,000 Earths could fit inside. Jupiter also is the oldest planet, forming from the dust and gases left over from the Sun's formation 4.5 billion years ago.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="planet" id="saturn">
                <img src="satrun.jpeg" alt="Saturn">
                <h3>Saturn</h3>
                <p>Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second largest in the Solar System, after Jupiter. It is a gas giant, with an average radius of about nine and a half times that of Earth. It has an eighth the average density of Earth, but is over 95 times more massive.</p>

            <div class="planet" id="uranus">
                <img src="uranus.jpeg" alt="Uranus">
                <h3>Uranus</h3>
                <p>Uranus is a very cold and windy planet. It is surrounded by faint rings, and more than two dozen small moons as it rotates at a nearly 90-degree angle from the plane of its orbit. This unique tilt makes Uranus appear to spin on its side.</p>

            <div class="planet" id="neptune">
                <img src="neptune.jpeg" alt="Neptune">
                <h3>Neptune</h3>
                <p>Neptune is the eighth planet from the sun, the fourth largest, and a gas planet. It is named after the Roman god of the sea. Neptune is four times the size of Earth, and its day lasts a little more than 16 hours. Its year is about 165 Earth years.</p>
